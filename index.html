<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I graduated from MIT in 2024 as a double major S.B. in Mathematics (course 18) and Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science (course 6-14) with a M.Eng. in Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. During AY 2024-2025 I'm a Part III student, i.e., pursuing a MASt in Pure Mathematics from the University of Cambridge, at Trinity College. I will begin my PhD at Stanford in the Department of Mathematics in 2025. </p>
<p> My research interests include probability, combinatorics, and discrete geometry. </p>
